TO DO
==========================
- deal out the deck and shuffle whenever it gets close to the bottom.
	this will improve performance greatly during testing, since it's waiting for the randomizer singleton a lot

- UI cleanup:
	add button to display and test hand-coded strategy
	handle resize of main window.  
	fix scrolling region for status messages (it extends beyond the visible), 
	disable button when calculating
