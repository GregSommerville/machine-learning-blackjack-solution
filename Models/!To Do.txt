TO DO
==========================
- UI cleanup:
	display each generation: best of that gen - passed as a param to the per-gen callback
		- also, display * or something on the status msg when a new best is found
		- format status msg so gens are 4 digits, best and averages have fixed widths, so everything lines up
	add button to display and test hand-coded strategy
	improve the algorithm by making pairs happen more: deck.MoveNextToTop(Ace), which makes that the next to be dealt, may shuffle if needed

	handle resize of main window.  
	fix scrolling region for status messages (it extends beyond the visible), 
	disable button when calculating
